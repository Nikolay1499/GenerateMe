# GenerateMe
A generative adversarial network using Pytorch which when trained will be used by a flask web application to display the generated images. The applcation will be then put in a docker container and deployed to a cloud platform(probably AWS). The website will have to option to generate images with a linear generator and a convolutional generator so the users can compare the quality of GAN vs DCGAN.
